# Exploring_weather_trends
This is the first project done on [Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002), where I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends where I currently live to overall global temperature trends.

## Getting started
To replicate the project you need to work with
* MS Excel
* SQL

## Instructions
The goal of the project was to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where I live now (Tokyo). To do this, I followed the steps below:
* **Extract the data** from an online Udacity's database using SQL queris
* **Open up the CSV files** using MS Excel
* **Make observations** about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your Tokyoâ€™s averages.
