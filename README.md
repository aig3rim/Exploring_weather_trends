# Exploring_weather_trends
This is the first project done on [Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002), where I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends where I currently live to overall global temperature trends.

## Getting started
To replicate the project you need to work with
* MS Excel
* SQL

## Instructions
The goal of the project was to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where I live now (Tokyo). To do this, I followed the steps below:
* **Extract the data** from an online Udacity's database using SQL queris
* **Open up the CSV files** using MS Excel
* **Make observations** about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your Tokyo’s averages.

## Key findings
* The average temperature in the world and in Tokyo has been increased for about 2 °C degrees
* The growth of the average temperature for the world and Tokyo has gradual behavior
* It is warmer in Tokyo than in the world. According to the recent data, the average temperature in Tokyo is slightly below 14 °C degrees, while in the world it is almost 10 °C degrees. Also, this temperature difference is consistent over the last one and half hundred years
* The average temperature increase has started from around 1900 year for both the world and Tokyo. However, for more concise observations the average temperature in Tokyo before 1845 year is needed
* The record for the average global temperature is longer (1750 – 2015, 266 years) than for Tokyo (1845 – 2013, 169 years)
* 10-year moving average data is smoother for the world than for Tokyo, where some fluctuations are presented
